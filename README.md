# Sorted Index Finder

A JavaScript exercise that determines the lowest index at which a given value should be inserted into an array 
once it has been sorted in ascending order. fCC Lab
The project demonstrates the use of higher‑order functions such as 
`sort` and `findIndex` to compute the correct insertion position.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts an array and a number as inputs.
- Sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort` method.
- Uses `findIndex` to locate the correct insertion point.
- Returns the lowest valid index where the number should be inserted.
- Always returns a numeric value, even when the array is empty or the number is larger than all elements.
